# Beach Resort Booking System - Seeder Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive summary of the Laravel 12 Beach Resort Booking System seeders and migrations implemented according to PSR-12 standards with production safety measures.

## Migration Files Created

### 1. Additive Migration: Promo Window Columns
**File:** `2025_12_14_000001_add_promo_window_columns.php`
- Adds `starts_at` and `ends_at` timestamp columns to promos table
- Adds indexes for performance: `idx_promo_active_window` and `idx_promo_active_expires`

### 2. Additive Migration: Missing Indexes
**File:** `2025_12_14_000002_add_missing_indexes.php`
- Adds performance indexes across multiple tables:
  - `amenities`: status index
  - `amenity_room`: unique constraint on amenity_id, room_id
  - `rooms`: status, price_per_night, quantity indexes
  - `bookings`: promo_id, user_id, paid_at indexes
  - `reviews`: user_id, room_id, type, rating, created_at indexes

## Seeder Files Created/Updated

### 5. ReviewSeeder (New)
**File:** `database/seeders/ReviewSeeder.php`
- **Production Safe**: Early return if environment is 'production'
- **Environment Gated**: Only runs in local/dev/development/staging/uat
- **Laravel 12 Optimized**: Uses global `fake()` helper instead of Faker imports

  - Always runs: RoomSeeder, AmenitySeeder, PromoSeeder, MealPriceSeeder
  - Environment gated: BookingSeeder, ReviewSeeder (only DEV/UAT)

## Factory Updates

### UserFactory (Updated)
**File:** `database/factories/UserFactory.php`
- Improved for Philippines locale (+63 phone numbers)
- Proper password hashing
- Default role assignment

## Key Features Implemented

### Laravel 12 Compatibility
- **Modern Faker Usage**: All seeders use Laravel 12's global `fake()` helper instead of importing Faker\Factory
- **Optimized Performance**: Removed unnecessary Faker instance creation and seeding
- **Clean Code**: Simplified seeder structure following Laravel 12 best practices

### Production Safety
- BookingSeeder and ReviewSeeder check environment and skip in production
- DatabaseSeeder implements conditional seeding based on environment
- All seeders use early returns with warning messages in production

### Idempotency
- All production-safe seeders use `updateOrCreate` or `firstOrCreate`
- Unique constraints prevent duplicates
- Safe to run multiple times without side effects

### Promo Eligibility Logic
Comprehensive promo validation including:
- Active status check
- Booking creation time vs expires_at
- Max uses tracking
- Date window validation (starts_at/ends_at)
- Exclusive promo handling

### Availability Tracking
- In-memory occupancy map prevents overbooking
- Tracks room quantities per date
- Validates availability before creating bookings
- Ensures no conflicts across room types

### Realistic Data Generation
- **Laravel 12 Integration**: Uses global `fake()` helper for modern Laravel compatibility
- Proper guest distribution across room capacity
- Realistic meal pricing integration
- Mixed payment statuses and options
- Philippines-specific phone numbers and locale (+63 format)
- **Enhanced Guest Data**: Always includes contact details for realistic booking scenarios

## Database Integrity Checks

All seeders implement validation to ensure:
- **Bookings**: No Nov/Dec dates, proper pricing calculations, availability constraints
- **Reviews**: Only for eligible bookings, unique constraints respected
- **Promos**: Valid window configurations, proper scope applications
- **Rooms**: Correct quantities and pricing alignment

## Commands for Execution

```bash
# Individual seeders
php artisan db:seed --class=RoomSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=AmenitySeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=PromoSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=BookingSeeder    # Auto-skips in production
php artisan db:seed --class=ReviewSeeder     # Auto-skips in production

# Run all seeders
php artisan db:seed
```

## Production Deployment Notes

1. **Migrations**: Run the additive migrations first
2. **Seeders**: Only production-safe seeders will execute in production
3. **Data Integrity**: All production seeders are idempotent and safe to re-run
4. **Environment**: BookingSeeder and ReviewSeeder are automatically skipped in production

This implementation provides a robust, production-ready seeding system with comprehensive data generation for development and testing environments while maintaining safety for production deployments.
